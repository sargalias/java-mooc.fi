                "I think the course was amazing overall. It feels like it covered all the important parts of Java, at least for a beginner to the language." +

                "One thing I think could be improved though is the TMC and the instructions for submitting the exercises." +
                "I'm using IntelliJ, and at first I had a lot of trouble getting the tests to run locally and getting the exercises to submit." +
                "I started out running only server tests and submitting the exercises manually." +
                "Even after I got it working, sometimes local tests wouldn't run again." +
                "Then after re-installing IntelliJ a few times and also deleting the exercise directory and re-downloading many times, it magically worked in the end." +
                "I don't think I did anything different. It just happened to work." +

                "Otherwise, a minor change would be updating the links throughout the text to the more recent Java version 9 links. Most of them point to Java 6 links." +
                "But overall, possibly the best Java course out there for beginners. Extremely well done and thank you."
